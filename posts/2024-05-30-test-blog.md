# Test Blog Post

This is a **test** blog post created on May 30, 2024. It is used to verify that the ingestion system correctly tags files in `/posts/` as `type: 'blog'` in the Supabase vector database.

- This post should appear in the vector DB with type 'blog'.
- It should be chunked and embedded like other documents.

If you see this content in a search or in the DB, the test is successful!
