# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build modern web applications with ease. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and best practices for getting started with Next.js.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits for web development:

- Server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO
- Static site generation (SSG) for blazing-fast page loads
- API routes for building backend functionality
- Built-in routing system
- Excellent developer experience

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── page.tsx
  │   ├── layout.tsx
  │   └── globals.css
  ├── public/
  │   └── images/
  ├── components/
  │   └── ui/
  ├── lib/
  │   └── utils.ts
  ├── package.json
  └── tsconfig.json
```

## Key Features

### 1. App Router

The App Router is Next.js's new routing system that uses React Server Components by default:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js</h1>
    </main>
  )
}
```

### 2. Server Components

Server Components allow you to write UI that can be rendered and cached on the server:

```typescript
// app/components/ServerComponent.tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <div>{data.title}</div>
}
```

### 3. Client Components

For interactive components, you can use the 'use client' directive:

```typescript
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by Default**
   - Only use Client Components when you need interactivity
   - Keep the client bundle size small

2. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   - Use error boundaries
   - Handle loading states
   - Implement proper error pages

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Use Image component for optimized images
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Conclusion

Next.js provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. By following these best practices and leveraging its features, you can create performant and maintainable applications.
